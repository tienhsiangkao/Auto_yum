# Auto_yum
This is an totally automatic shell for setting up basic development environment
for CentOS and RHEL, including repositories, c, c++, Fortran and Python. Apart
from languages, other tools such as make, Cmake, git and etc are going to be
installed either. Generally speaking, any OS which support yum can run this,
however, this shell tested on CentOS7 only. If you have any comments and feedbacks,
please feel free to reach me at tienhsiangkao@gmail.com.
